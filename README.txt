On most websites, behind the scenes Apache is running. It serves your webpages.
The default configuration of Apache was to serve <index> file if no file was mentioned. 
So creating an index file is standard practice.

Emmit helps us speed up our code with the help of abbreviations. VScode includes Emmit by default.

Live Server helps to reflect changes in your file on the browser without the need of reloading

It is known that a heading in h1 tag is bigger than a heading in h2 tag.
But this is not true, we can make the heading in h2 even larger than h1 using css.
h1 means that this is the core part of the page 
similarly h2 means it is a subheading and holds less importance.
Structuring your page helps browser understand it better.


HTML is a structure language, gives structure to your page

tags are not case sensitive


boiler plate explained : 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>

</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

Since HTML is not the only markup language, there are others like xml, xhtml, latex. So we need to tell the browser that what language is our document using. To do this we use "DOCTYPE"

<html lang="en"></html> defines the language we are using

<html> has 2 children <head> and <body> which can further have more children

<body> contains all the visual part of the page 
<head> has only 2 things to display - title and favicon(icon)

<meta> tags are used to give information to the server or any bots that visit the site which don't want to display
